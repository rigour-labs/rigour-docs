# 🛡️ Rigour

**The Control Room for AI-Assisted Engineering.**

Rigour is a high-fidelity governance platform that ensures AI agents (Cursor, Claude, VS Code) follow your project's engineering standards. It bridges the gap between AI creativity and production-grade reliability.

## ⚡ Quick Start (60 Seconds)

You don't need to read a book. Just run these 3 commands in your project root:

### 1. Initialize
Align Rigour with your project's role (API, UI, etc.) and paradigm (OOP, Functional).
```bash
npx @rigour-labs/cli init
```

### 2. Index
Build a semantic map of your codebase so AI agents can "reason" about your patterns.
```bash
npx @rigour-labs/cli index --semantic
```

### 3. Govern (Launch Studio)
Open the visual Mission Control to shadow AI agents and arbitrate decisions in real-time.
```bash
npx @rigour-labs/cli studio
```

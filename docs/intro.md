# 🛡️ Rigour

**The Control Room for AI-Assisted Engineering.**

Rigour is a high-fidelity governance platform that ensures AI agents (Cursor, Claude, VS Code) follow your project's engineering standards. It bridges the gap between AI creativity and production-grade reliability.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start (60 Seconds)

You don't need to read a book. Just run these 3 commands in your project root:

### 1. Initialize
Align Rigour with your project's role (API, UI, etc.) and paradigm (OOP, Functional).
```bash
npx @rigour-labs/cli init
```

### 2. Index
Build a semantic map of your codebase so AI agents can "reason" about your patterns.
```bash
npx @rigour-labs/cli index --semantic
```

### 3. Govern (Launch Studio)
Open the visual Mission Control to shadow AI agents and arbitrate decisions in real-time.
```bash
npx @rigour-labs/cli studio
```

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Universal Semantic Search**: Ask your codebase questions in natural language.
*   **Live Shadowing**: Watch every AI tool call and decision in a real-time audit trail.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**: Approve or Reject AI changes directly from the browser.
*   **Polyglot Support**: High-fidelity indexing for Python, Go, Rust, Java, C++, TypeScript, and more.

## 🛡️ "Local Honest" Governance

Rigour is built on a "Local-First" philosophy. We believe that engineering governance should be private, instantaneous, and strictly under your control.

*   **No Login Required**: Start governing in 60 seconds without creating an account.
*   **Zero-Telemetry**: Your source code and command history never leave your machine.
*   **Air-Gapped Sync**: The "Local Bridge" between your IDE and Studio happens entirely on your local filesystem.

*This isn't just a feature—it's our trust moat.*
